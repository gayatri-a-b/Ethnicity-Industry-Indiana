### Problem statement

How does Census data on geographic distribution of ethnicity by county in Indiana related to the distribution of industry in Indiana?

### Graph and Progress

This week I went through my data and cleaned it up. It was a lot to clean up, but now I have every county and every subdivision of race provided by census reporter. I also decided to focus on the races: black, white, asian, native american, hispanic, and to leave out pacific islanders.


```{r first_plot}

# read table for all races

combined_race  <- read_csv("raw-data/all_races.csv") %>%
  clean_names()


# filter data for hamilton county only

hamilton_county <- combined_race %>% 
  select(ethnicity, race, hamilton_county_in) %>% 
  filter(hamilton_county_in != 0, race != "White") %>% 
  arrange(desc(hamilton_county_in))


# filter data for tippecanoe  county

hamilton_county <- combined_race %>% 
  select(ethnicity, race, tippecanoe_county_in) %>% 
  filter(tippecanoe_county_in != 0, race != "White") %>% 
  arrange(desc(tippecanoe_county_in))


# filter data for brown county

hamilton_county <- combined_race %>% 
  select(ethnicity, race, brown_county_in) %>% 
  filter(brown_county_in != 0, race != "White") %>% 
  arrange(desc(brown_county_in))


# filter data for lake county

hamilton_county <- combined_race %>% 
  select(ethnicity, race, lake_county_in) %>% 
  filter(lake_county_in != 0, race != "White") %>% 
  arrange(desc(lake_county_in))


# filter data for vigo county

hamilton_county <- combined_race %>% 
  select(ethnicity, race, vigo_county_in) %>% 
  filter(vigo_county_in != 0, race != "White") %>% 
  arrange(desc(vigo_county_in))
