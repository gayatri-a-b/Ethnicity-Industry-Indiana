GOV 1005 Final Project


## Milestone #3
Speak with any member of the course staff (CA or TF) about your final project. This is the second of three required meetings. In addition to this meeting, you must create a rough Github repo, with at least some of your raw data or code which shows you working with data that is stored elsewhere or details of your plan to get the data, and a reproducible html which provides a brief description of the data: where you got it, what you have done with it so far and what you plan to do. You may change your project completely, all the way until Demo Day. But you are still responsible for meeting these milestones, even if you know you are going to pivot. Your data can not be from a single source. Typing library(fivethirtyeight) is not enough!


## Milestone #4
Create a beautiful ggplot2 graphic which uses some of your data.


## Milestone #5
Create an Rmd/html which provides a draft of your About page. All of your data processing should be complete. Remember: You must gather data from two or more different sources. Learning how to source, clean and combine data is one of the goals of the project. On almost any topic, there are useful tables of information on Wikipedia. See [here]("https://categitau.com/using-rvest-to-scrape-data-from-wikipedia/") and [here]("https://medium.com/@kyleake/wikipedia-data-scraping-with-r-rvest-in-action-3c419db9af2d") for advice.
