### The Data

These visualizations are based on two data sets. The first is [Indiana Map](https://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html?category=Ethnicity) which offers the distribution of every possible ethnicity in Indiana at the county subdivision level. The second is [Hoosiers By the Numbers Quartery Census of Employment and Wages](http://www.hoosierdata.in.gov/dpage.asp?id=25&page_path=&path_id=&menu_level=&panel_number=2&view_number=3).
