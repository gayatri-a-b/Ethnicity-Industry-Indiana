### The Data

These visualizations are based on two data sets. The first is breakdown of race in each Indiana county provided on [Census Reporter]("https://censusreporter.org/"). The data for detailed race tables per county are given separately per major race group. I aggregated the most popular ethnicities (grouped by county) into one Excel Sheet. Additionally, I obtained a second dataset from copying data about industry by county from [Hoosiers By the Numbers Business Lookup Tool]("http://www.hoosierdata.in.gov/buslookup/BusLookup.aspx").
